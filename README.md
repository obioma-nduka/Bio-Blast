# Bio Blast

**Bio Blast** is a web application designed to manage user profiles, including their bios, quotes, study groups, and hobbies. Users can register, log in, and access a dashboard to add, edit, and delete profiles. The application features a dynamic navigation bar, secure access control, and a clean, responsive user interface.

Would you also like me to generate a quick badge set (like "Built With: Node.js, Express, SQLite") for the top of the README? ðŸš€  
It would make it even cleaner!
